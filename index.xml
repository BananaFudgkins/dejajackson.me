      <description>This was the presentation my team and I made of our system:
 The primary goal of this project was to create an information system that could connect pet shelters with potential adopters. Millions of pets are euthanized every year due to an inability to find an owner.</description>

      <description>Define is a speech recognition app that allows you to find the definition of the words you hear. Simply point your device at what you want to listen to, and you will be able to define each word.

      <description>Revolutionary Technology Eyedentify uses Apple&amp;rsquo;s Vision framework for object recognition. Recognition is incredibly fast and done completely on-device, meaning an internet connection is not required.
Cutting Edge Object Recognition To recognize an object, simply point your phone at whatever object you want to recognize and tap the screen. You can also use voice commands such as &amp;ldquo;What am I looking at?&amp;rdquo; and even translate into other languages with &amp;ldquo;What is this in Italian?</description>

      <title>New Website, Who This?</title>

      <description>As can be seen by the new look, my website has moved! It is now in the hands of a static site generator, Hugo. The move from Squarespace will save me $16 a month. Plus I get more flexibility in terms of the content I have on here! GitHub Pages is truly a magical thing. The site is currently under construction but will be fully up and running soon. Looking forward to this new static-y chapter for my website!</description>
