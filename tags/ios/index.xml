      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Peer2Power app arose out of a need to develop a digital solution that could meet the needs of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.lafayette.edu/clarkeaj/gov-lab/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;undergraduate research group&lt;/a&gt;&#xA; I was part of. The study I participated on was meant to assess the effectiveness of friend-to-friend recruitment of volunteers for political campaigns. Extant literature examined the effect of social pressure on voter turnout but not volunteer recruitment. We modelled our study on a group called Empower, which used an app to collect contact information and for participants to complete tasks relevant to the study. However, Empower&amp;rsquo;s study focused on voter turnout. After surveying civic involvement apps already on the market, we were unable to find one that fit our exact needs. Thus, I developed a custom app that focused on volunteer recruitment, supported random assignment into control and treatment groups, and provided digital surveys we could use to collect relevant data.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
