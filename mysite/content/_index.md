I'm Deja Jackson, an iOS software engineer. I'm an undergraduate student and have been making iOS apps since middle school.
The first iOS app I ever made was called Clone, a social network that was not unique in any way.
Since then, I have gone on to create various products that are currently or soon will be on the App Store.
I have also made several apps with my team The Three Bruhsketeers including Eyedentify.
