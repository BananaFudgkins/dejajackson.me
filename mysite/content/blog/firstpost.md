As can be seen by the new look, my website has moved!
It is now in the hands of a static site generator, Hugo.
The move from Squarespace will save me $16 a month. Plus I get more flexibility
in terms of the content I have on here! GitHub Pages is truly a magical thing.
The site is currently under construction but will be fully up and running soon.
Looking forward to this new static-y chapter for my website!
