## Figures

I made a series of visualizations in RStudio for this report. You can view them below.

![Difference of categorical average funding from the aggregate average](/stugov_report_visualizations/diff_cat_avg_agg_avg.png) This graph was made in Google Sheets due as this was a last minute addition and there were time constraints.

![Percent breakdown of budget allocations](/stugov_report_visualizations/all_prop_by_category.png)

![Average budget allocations by club category](/stugov_report_visualizations/avg_alls.png)
