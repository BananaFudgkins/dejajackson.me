This was the presentation my team and I made of our system called "Breadnbutter":

The primary goal of this project was to create an information system that could connect pet shelters with potential adopters.
Millions of pets are euthanized every year due to an inability to find an owner.

My team and I built this system in Qt Creator and wrote it in C++. I was responsible for the SQL queries our system would make. I also had to write logic to convert the contents of our SQL database into data types our frontend client could use.

I've made a fork of our repo to bring the app back up to a useable state. If you are on Mac, you can download a copy of the system [here.](https://github.com/jacksodl23/cs-205-pet-adoption/releases/tag/v1.0)
